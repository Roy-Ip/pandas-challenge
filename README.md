Monash Data Analytics Bootcamp - Module 4 Assignment 

I have uploaded the following:
    1. Resources folder - it contains the datasets
    2. PyCitySchools_starter - it is the Jupyter file for the solutions
    3. Written Report.txt & Written Report.docx - it is a text written report summarising the analysis
    4. PyCitySchools_starter_detailed - it is a more detailed version showing the work step by step (The codes are pretty much the same, I just break the codes down into more cells when I was going through the process. I uploaded it here for my reference only, you don't need to look at it.)
